> Run imager
> Select Pi OS (Other) > Pi OS Lite (32bit)
> Select SD Card
> Click write

> Remove SD card and reinsert it into the computer
> create a file in the boot of the SD card called "ssh"
> create a file in the boot of the ST card called "wpa_supplicant.conf" and insert the following (Use a hotspot on your phone if a normal wifi network is not available)
>>
country=NL
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid="Existing Wifi name"
    psk="wifipassword"
}
<<
> Remove SD card and insert in Raspberry Pi
> Boot the Pi

++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Setup SSH and passwordless access ++++++++++++++++++++++++++
> Search for Powershell in startmenu and open as administrator
> test the ssh to the pi with: ssh pi@<RPi address> 		| In my case: ssh pi@10.0.0.104 find pi address with wireshark or router client list)
> enter password: raspberry
	> if it works, exit ssh with command: exit
	> if it doesn't work, retry wireshark or god be with you

Now we will setup SSH keys for passwordless access
> Type in powershell: cd ~/.ssh
> Type in powershell: rm id*
> Type in powershell: ssh-keygen
> Hit enter 3 times
> Type next command with the correct RPi IP address here --V
> Type in powershell: cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh pi@<RPi IP address> 'mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'			| You can copy this and paste with rightclick in powershell or terminal
> As password type: raspberry
> Check if you can ssh without giving password: ssh pi@<RPi IP address>
> If no password was asked, continue. Otherwise try this block again.

Update the pi with:
	> sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
