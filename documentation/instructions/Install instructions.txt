++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Installing Ubuntu ++++++++++++++++++++++++++
- Install Ubuntu 20.04

- Open a terminal window

Update Ubuntu
> sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

Install Visual Studio Code insiders
> sudo snap install --classic code-insiders

++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Cloning repo ++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Create a new working directory that is the same as this guide for easy reference
> sudo mkdir /data
> sudo chmod 777 /data

Configure git (Special email can be found on the github settings page of your account https://github.com/settings/emails)
> git config --global user.name "<username>"                |ex. git config --global user.name "Zamtakk"
> git config --global user.email "<special_github_email>"   |ex. git config --global user.email "28710885+Zamtakk@users.noreply.github.com"
> git config --global credential.helper store

Create folders for repo
> mkdir /data/rpi_code_project_system_development_2020
> mkdir /data/wemos_code_project_system_development_2020

Clone repo using git
> git clone https://github.com/Zamtakk/Project_System_Development_2020_RPi_Code.git /data/rpi_code_project_system_development_2020/
> git clone https://github.com/Zamtakk/Project_System_Development_2020_Wemos_Code.git /data/wemos_code_project_system_development_2020/

++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Installing Raspberry ++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Install raspberry pi imager
> sudo snap install rpi-imager

- Insert SD card in computer
- Run imager
- Select Pi OS (Other) > Pi OS Lite (32bit)
- Select SD Card
- Click write

If the card is auto ejected
    - Remove SD card and reinsert it into the computer to reconnect

Enable SSH by creating a file in the root of the sd card.
- Open a terminal in the root of the card. (Can be done with rightclick in the files app)
Create a file in the boot of the SD card called "ssh"
> touch ssh
Create a file in the boot of the SD card for the network settings (Use a hotspot on your phone if a normal wifi network is not available)
> nano wpa_supplicant.conf
>>>>
country=NL
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid="<existing_wifi_name>"
    psk="<wifipassword>"
}
<<<<
- Eject the SD card and insert in Raspberry Pi
- Boot the Pi

++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Setup SSH and passwordless access ++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Test ssh to the pi
> ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
Enter password
> raspberry
If it works, exit ssh with command
    > exit
If it doesn't work then maybe raspberrypi.local is not working for some reason. Replace it with the IP address of the pi

Now we will setup SSH keys for passwordless access
Navigate to the ssh folder in a linux terminal
> cd ~/.ssh
Check if existing keys are present
> ls -la
If there are no files named 'id_rsa.pub' and 'id_rsa'
    Create new keys (No sudo!!)
    > ssh-keygen
    - Hit enter three times

Now we will copy the needed files to the pi
> cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh pi@raspberrypi.local 'mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
Type in the raspberry pi password
> raspberry
Check if you can ssh without giving password
> ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
If a password was still asked
    - Cancel the operation with Ctrl + C
    Remove all existing ssh keys
    > rm ~/.ssh/*rsa*
    - Go back and start from the beginning of the previous paragraph
