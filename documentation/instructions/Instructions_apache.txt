Installing apache2 webserver

Make sure your Pi is connected to the internet! (revert the script changes or connect to a router and SSH over your LAN)

Follow this tutorial: https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-apache/ use pjsdvgroup13.com rather than example.com.

Use the command:
  sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
  
To easily change/code a website get the following extension in vscode:
  - Live Server by Ritwick Dey

To load the code on the webserver use SFTP to copy over the files to the /var/www/pjsdvgroup13.com/public_html/ folder
  > alternatively just create the following files in the folder:
    -index.html
    -style.css
    -communication.js
    
    and copy over the code to the corresponding file.

The code can be found on github in the Web code folder.
